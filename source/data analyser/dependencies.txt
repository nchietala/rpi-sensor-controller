This is a program that assumes that the sensor controller has been used to count the rotations
of moths attached to circular mills and produces PDFs according to how they rotated and tripped
the hall sensors.
This program relies on an external library: Apache PDFBox, to write PDF files, it can be
downloaded from their website for whosoever would choose to compile this rather than using the
provided jar.
